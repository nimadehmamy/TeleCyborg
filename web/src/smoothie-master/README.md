Smoothie - a lightweight and modular JavaScript library
=======================================================

Well, I guess it will still take some time until this repository here contains
a whole library, but I'm working on it ;)

Right now it only contains my implementation of the CommonJS module
specification. More information can be found in my post at Pixel vs. Bytes:
